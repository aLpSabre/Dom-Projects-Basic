          What is the use of a namespace in Web Development?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            A namespace is a simple global object that is used to hold methods,
            properties, and other objects in them. It adds ease of use via
            modularity, thereby, providing users with the ability to reuse the
            code and avoid naming conflicts.

        <div class="question">What is SVG and why is it used?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is used to display
          vector-based graphics over the web. The graphical content it can
          render is based on an XML format. With SVG, the graphical content is
          of superior quality thereby providing the user with the ability to
          furnish high-quality images.
